# ‚úâÔ∏è Hope's Message: Platformer Adventure

This is a 2D multi-level platformer game I made using p5.js and p5.play where the user players must race to collect letters in time and simultaneously also evade monsters through various distinct worlds with diverse themes. Can you collect all the letters in time to reveal Hope's message?

## üéÆ How to Play

* Control the player using the arrow keys:
* ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Left / ‚û°Ô∏è Right to move horizontally
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Up to jump
* Your goal is to *collect all 10 letter in each level before the 20 second time limit runs out.
* You shouldn't fall from platforms and collide with monsters, or the level will restart if you do!

## üß† Things I learned

I learned to create sprites that can collide with other game objects in p5.play. Creating various levels and designing platforms for all 4 levels. How to move the camera so that it follows the player when it moves forward. Buttons to select levels and return to home page after completing a level. Creating a countdown timer and also win(when you collect all 10 letters in a level before time runs out)/loose(The time runs out, you come in contact with a monster, you fall off platforms) conditioning. Changing the screen size for supporting different screen sizes.
