# ✉️ Hope's Message: Platformer Adventure

This is s multi-level 2D platformer game that I built with p5.js and p5.play where the user players race against time to collect letters and also at the same time dodge monsters across unique worlds of different themes. Can you collect all the letters in time to reveal Hope's message?

## 🎮 How to Play

* Use the arrow keys to move the player:
  * ⬅️ Left / ➡️ Right to move horizontally
  * ⬆️ Up to jump
* Your goal is to *ollect all 10 letter in each level before the 20 second timer runs out.
* You should avoid falling off platforms and colliding with monsters, if you do so then the level will restart!

## 🧠 Things I learned

I learned how to create sprites that are collidable with other objects in the game using p5.play. Creating varoius levels and creating platforms for all 4 levels. How to move the camera so that it follows the player when it moves ahead. Buttons to select levels and return to home page after finishing a level. Creating a countdown timer and also win(🎉 when you collect all 10 letters in a level before time runs out)/loose(💀 The time runs out, you touch a monster, you fall off platforms) conditioning. Changeing the screen size for fitting in different screen sizes.
